Authentication and Diagnostics
===============================

This is a hands-on lab for authenticating an example application using Windows Azure ACS, and performing diagnostics on the application once it has been deployed.

Pre-requisites
--------------

1. Visual Studio 2012 or later
2. [Identity and Access Tools for Visual Studio 2012] (http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/e21bf653-dfe1-4d81-b3d3-795cb104066e)
3. [WCF Data Services 5.3 Tools](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35840)

Instructions
------------

Follow Exercise 1 in the hands-on lab at http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brunoterkaly/archive/2014/03/03/introduction-to-windows-azure-active-directory.aspx. This exercise will show you how to provision a new Windows Azure Active Directory Tenant and hook it up to a new MVC application.

If you finish early, try tackling Exercise 2. This will involve querying your Active Directory for user data and displaying it in your application.
